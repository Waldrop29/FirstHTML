# Grocery List App

This project is a simple Grocery List application that allows users to add and manage their grocery items. The app provides a user-friendly interface for adding items, displaying the list of groceries, and deleting items as needed.

## Features

- Add grocery items to the list.
- Delete items from the list.
- The list is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists even after refreshing the page.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Type a grocery item into the input field.
3. Click the "Add" button or press the "Enter" key to add the item to the list.
4. To remove an item, click the "Delete" button next to the item.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the app by modifying the CSS styles in the `index.html` file. Consider changing:

- Background color
- Font styles and sizes
- Button colors and hover effects
- Layout properties for a different look and feel
